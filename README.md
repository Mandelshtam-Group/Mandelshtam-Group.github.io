# Mandelshtam Website
Welcome to the Github Repository for the website!

# Contributing to the Project
Here we provide a quick summary for contributing to the project (intended for new group members).
The internet is a much better resource for working with Git/Github, please refer to the official documentation. 

## Fork the Original Repository
Go the the Mandelshtam-Group [Repository](https://github.com/Mandelshtam-Group/Mandelshtam-Group.github.io) and use the fork option to make your own version of the website repository (user/Mandelshtam-Group.github.io). 

## Clone YOUR Website Repository 
Now that you have a personal version of the website you can clone this to start developing locally.
To do this go to your version of the website repo and use the clone url.

## Connecting Upstream
It is possible that the original version of the Website (Mandelshtam-Group) will be changing as other group members work on the project.
We therefore need to connect our forked version to the original (upstream) (this only needs to be done once).

On terminal in your version of the website repo Use git remote add upstream (upstream git url)
where the url is the origial clone url from the Mandelshtam-Group Github repo.

Onc eyou have set the upstream you can use the git pull upstream master command to incorporate new changes into your development (note git pull combines git fetch and git merge into 1 action, it is easier). 
You should check back with the upstream branch frequently to make sure your development is up-to-date.

## Developing Your Version of the Website
Now that you have a local version that is up-to-date with the upstream, you are free to develop and edit.
Once you are happy you can add commit and push to your version of the Website Repository. 
(As a note you may want to look into [branching](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) when you develop).
